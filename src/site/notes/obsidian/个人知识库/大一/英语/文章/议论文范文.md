## 范文
*<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">With advancements in</mark>  housing, and optimization of dietary structure ,the increase in average lifespans has become an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unstoppable societal trend</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">As a result</mark>, the proportion <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">of previous generations</mark> continues to rise, bringing both benefits and challenges.*

*<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The elderly</mark> contribute significantly to society by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fostering family unity</mark>. During festivals like the Spring Festival, young people working away from home return to their <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">elders</mark>, creating a strong sense of belonging. Moreover, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">seniors</mark> serve as vital<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> conduit</mark>s of culture. On breezy summer evenings or cozy winter days <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">around a stove brewing tea</mark>, cultural <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">inheritance</mark> occurs as<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> elders</mark> engage in gentle conversations with the younger generation.*

*However, the elderly are also confronted with considerable challenges. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mentally</mark>, retirement can<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> trigger</mark> issues <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">related to</mark> self-identity and self-worth, leading to a sense of purposelessness. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Socially</mark>, the loss of spouses and friends may cause their social circles to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">diminish</mark>, reducing opportunities for social engagement.*

*To address these issues with the knowledge of Computer Science and Technology, I suggest two <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">targeted initiatives</mark>. Firstly, design online courses<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> tailored for</mark> seniors to help bridge the gap between them and modern developments, thus enhancing their self-identity through self-improvement. Secondly, virtual characters created by VR and AR technologies will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> enable</mark> <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> seniors</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">revisit</mark> cherished memories and  experence the warmth of family reunions.*

*<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Acknowledgin</mark><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">g</mark> the contributions and challenges faced by<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> the elderly</mark> is essential. Although technological solutions have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">proven effective</mark> in some respects, a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">comprehensive resolution</mark> of these issues demands the<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> collaborative efforts</mark> of professionals from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diverse</mark> fields.*
